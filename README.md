I developed some Java Programming Codes as a Internship Task for @OasisInfobyte . It consists of Tasks such as Number Guessing Game ( which gives the user reliability to fresh up mind and challenge themshelves to guess the right/correct number ) and ATM Interface ( which helps the user to withdraw & deposit the money and checking the balance and also see the transaction history ) .
